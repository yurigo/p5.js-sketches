# p5.js-sketches

A collection of creative coding sketches built with p5.js, exploring various programming concepts and visual effects.

## Available Sketches

### 🦄 [helloworld](sketches/helloworld/)

An introductory sketch featuring unicorn emojis and basic p5.js shapes.

### 🌊 [bezier](sketches/bezier/)

Animated bezier curves with flowing control points and colorful trails.

### 🎯 [arc](sketches/arc/)

Dynamic arc patterns with spiral animations and corner decorations.

### 🎨 [bauhaus](sketches/bauhaus/)

Minimalist design inspired by Bauhaus principles with geometric shapes and primary colors.

### 👤 [abstract-face](sketches/abstract-face/)

An expressive abstract representation of a face with animated features.

### 🌄 [minimalistic-landscape](sketches/minimalistic-landscape/)

A serene landscape scene with mountains, trees, and simple atmospheric elements.

### 🖱️ [mouse-interaction](sketches/mouse-interaction/)

Interactive sketch responding to mouse movement with trails, ripples, and attractors.

### ⚡ [physics](sketches/physics/)

Physics simulation featuring bouncing balls with collision detection and realistic motion.

### 🪃 [double-pendulum](sketches/double-pendulum/)

Chaotic motion simulation with 50 double pendulums creating beautiful trails and demonstrating sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

### ✨ [particles](sketches/particles/)

Advanced particle system with different emitter types: fountain, explosion, and spiral effects.

### ⚽ [bouncing-balls](sketches/bouncing-balls/)

Multiple balls with different positions and velocities bouncing inside the canvas with perfect elastic collisions.

### ⭐ [creative-bounce](sketches/creative-bounce/)

Custom shapes (stars, hearts, triangles) that bounce and change color and size with each collision.

### 🌍 [simulated-gravity](sketches/simulated-gravity/)

Demonstrates gravity simulation with a ball falling and bouncing with acceleration, visualizing physics in action.

### 📉 [energy-loss-bounce](sketches/energy-loss-bounce/)

Ball that loses energy with each bounce, gradually coming to rest - realistic physics with energy dissipation.

### 📀 [dvd-screensaver](sketches/dvd-screensaver/)

Classic DVD logo screensaver that bounces around changing colors, counting the elusive corner hits.

### 🔵 [grid-of-dots](sketches/grid-of-dots/)

Basic nested loops example showing how to create a grid pattern using x,y iteration with circles.

### ♟️ [chessboard](sketches/chessboard/)

Demonstrates conditional logic inside loops to create alternating patterns like a chessboard.

### 🌸 [radial-pattern](sketches/radial-pattern/)

Introduces transformations and circular loops to create mandala-like radial symmetry patterns.

### 🎨 [riley-movement-static](sketches/riley-movement-static/)

Op Art inspired by Bridget Riley's "Movement in Squares" - static version with systematic grid distortion creating optical illusions.

### 🖱️ [riley-movement-interactive](sketches/riley-movement-interactive/)

Interactive version of Riley's "Movement in Squares" where mouse position controls the distortion line in real-time.

### 🎨 [hsl-mouse-animation](sketches/hsl-mouse-animation/)

Interactive HSL color demonstration with mouse-controlled hue and saturation, featuring animated particles and real-time color feedback.

### 🎲 [random-chaos](sketches/random-chaos/)

Demonstrates pure randomness using p5.js's `random()` function. Each run generates a cloud of white dots in chaotic positions.

### 🎨 [random-seed-art](sketches/random-seed-art/)

Generative art demonstration using `randomSeed()` for deterministic artwork. Each seed value creates unique but reproducible art using HSL colors. Control the seed via URL parameter (?id=1234).

### � [noise-seed-art](sketches/noise-seed-art/)

Deterministic Perlin noise artwork using `noiseSeed()` to produce reproducible flowing organic structures. Change the seed with a URL parameter (e.g. `?id=42`) to explore variant but repeatable patterns.

### �🌫️ [noise-fluency](sketches/noise-fluency/)

Uses p5.js's `noise()` function to create smooth, flowing lines. Coherent noise generates continuous variations, ideal for simulating natural phenomena.

### ♾️ [infinite-variations](sketches/infinite-variations/)

Generates infinite variations using `random()` in every frame. Colors and positions change constantly, showing the creative potential of generative animation.

### 🔷 [quad-patterns](sketches/quad-patterns/)

Educational demonstration of the `quad()` function showing various quadrilateral shapes, overlapping patterns, and mathematical variations.

### 🧊 [isometric-cube-tessellation](sketches/isometric-cube-tessellation/)

Creates a tessellating pattern of 3D isometric cubes with random colors, demonstrating geometric transformations and grid arrangements.

### 🔷 [isometric-cube-tessellation-2](sketches/isometric-cube-tessellation-2/)

Hexagonal tessellation of isometric cubes in grayscale, showing an alternative approach to 3D cube patterns with precise geometric alignment.

### � [analog-clock](sketches/analog-clock/)

A functional analog clock with moving hands and time display.

### �📏 [line-comparison](sketches/line-comparison/)

Compares different line drawing techniques and visual styles.

### 📏 [line-comparison-animation](sketches/line-comparison-animation/)

Animated comparison of line drawing methods, showing dynamic changes over time.

### 🌪️ [line-with-noise](sketches/line-with-noise/)

Draws lines with Perlin noise for organic, wavy effects.

### 🎲 [line-with-random](sketches/line-with-random/)

Draws lines with random offsets for jagged, unpredictable shapes.

### 🌀 [noise-chaos](sketches/noise-chaos/)

Combines noise and randomness to create chaotic, animated patterns.

### 🔀 [random-vs-noise](sketches/random-vs-noise/)

Side-by-side comparison of random() and noise() for generative art.

### ⚡🐀⚡ [pokemon-art](sketches/pokemon-art/)

Art using pokemon images.
