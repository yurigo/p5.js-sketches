# Movement in Squares - Interactive

This interactive sketch is inspired by Bridget Riley's famous Op Art piece "Movement in Squares" (1961).

## Description

An interactive version where the mouse controls the distortion. The vertical line that creates the optical illusion follows the mouse's X position, allowing real-time exploration of how grid deformation affects visual perception.

## Interaction

- **Move mouse left/right**: Controls the position of the distortion line
- **Red line indicator**: Shows the current distortion center
- **Real-time feedback**: Grid responds immediately to mouse movement

## Techniques Used

- **Mouse interaction** with `mouseX` variable
- **Continuous drawing** (no `noLoop()`)
- **Real-time grid calculation** and rendering
- **Visual feedback** with distortion line indicator

## Educational Value

This interactive version helps understand:
- How slight geometric changes create strong visual effects
- The relationship between mathematical functions and visual perception
- The principles behind Op Art and kinetic illusions
- Interactive creative coding techniques

Perfect for exploring the boundaries between mathematics, art, and human perception.
