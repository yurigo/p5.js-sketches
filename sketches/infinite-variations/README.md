# Infinite Variations

This sketch generates infinite variations using `random()` in every frame. Colors and positions change constantly, showing the creative potential of generative animation.

```js
fill(random(255), random(255), random(255), 150);
ellipse(random(width), random(height), random(10, 50));
```

- **Concept:** Generative animation and variability.
- **Use case:** Exploring the creative potential of animated randomness.
