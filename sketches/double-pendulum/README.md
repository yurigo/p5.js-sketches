# Double Pendulum

A mesmerizing simulation of chaotic motion featuring 50 double pendulums, each with slightly different initial conditions.

## What it demonstrates

- **Chaos Theory**: Small differences in initial conditions lead to dramatically different outcomes
- **Double Pendulum Physics**: Complex motion arising from simple mechanical systems
- **Mathematical Beauty**: The intersection of physics, mathematics, and visual art
- **Trail Rendering**: Each pendulum leaves a colorful trail showing its path through time

## The Physics

Each double pendulum consists of two pendulum arms connected end-to-end. The motion is governed by coupled differential equations that create highly sensitive, chaotic behavior. Even tiny differences in starting angles (0.001 radians) result in completely different trajectories over time.

## Visual Elements

- 50 pendulums with random colors
- Real-time trail rendering showing pendulum paths
- Responsive canvas sizing
- Smooth animation with physics calculations

This sketch beautifully demonstrates how deterministic systems can exhibit chaotic behavior, creating patterns that are both unpredictable and mesmerizing.
