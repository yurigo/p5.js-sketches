# Movement in Squares - Static

This sketch is inspired by Bridget Riley's famous Op Art piece "Movement in Squares" (1961).

## Description

A static generative drawing that creates the illusion of movement through systematic distortion of a grid pattern. Black and white squares gradually deform into rectangles around a vertical line, producing an optical illusion of depth and movement.

## Techniques Used

- **Nested loops** for grid generation
- **Mathematical distortion** based on distance from a focal line
- **Checkerboard pattern** using modulo arithmetic
- **Geometric transformation** from squares to rectangles

## Op Art Concepts

- **Visual perception** and optical illusions
- **Systematic distortion** creating movement illusion
- **Black and white contrast** for maximum visual impact
- **Grid deformation** techniques in digital art

This sketch demonstrates how simple mathematical principles can create complex visual effects that play with human perception.
